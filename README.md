HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Copy both the "koi_cfg" folder and the "autoexec.cfg" file into TF2's default "cfg" folder. 

   (Default location for the cfg folder is "Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg")

2. Copy the "koi_custom" folder into TF2's default "custom" folder. 

   (Default location for the custom folder is "Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom")

3. Add the "Advanced launch options" through steam. To do this:
   - Find TF2 in your steam library
   - Right click on the game, and then click on "Properties"
   - Under the "General" tab, you will see a "Set Launch Options" area
   - Paste in the line of launch options seen below into that area, and then click OK

  Advanced launch options (copy+paste):
  
  -high -dxlevel 98 -sw -w 1920 -h 1080 -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd

4. RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL: Install Broesel Hud and ignore/replace the "koi_custom/resource/ui/..." items. If you do this step, use the custom "mainmenuoverride.res" found in the same primary directery as this README and not the one found in the koi_custom.
