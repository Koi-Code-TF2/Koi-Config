//Server tickrates
//TF2 is designed to only use 66 tick servers unless you do some weird voodoo magic
//Because of this, it is advised to use the following 2 network settings:
cl_cmdrate 66
cl_updaterate 66
//As expected, if for whatever weird reason you play on 128 / 132 tick servers, use the following:
//cl_cmdrate 128 / 132
//cl_updaterate 128 / 132

//Interp settings
//ASSUMING YOU PLAY ON 66 TICK SERVERS (see above for details)
cl_interp 0.0304
cl_interp_ratio 2
//Note 1: Many servers restrict cl_interp_ratio to be 1. This will not impact the above settings since
//        cl_interp 0.0304 will override ratio 1's 0.01515151515 value anyway - see below:
//        (cl_interp_ratio 1 / cl_updaterate 66 = 0.01515151515 interp at the lowest
//         cl_interp_ratio 2 / cl_updaterate 66 = 0.0303030303 interp at the lowest)
//Note 2: Setting cl_interp to 0.0152 even for projectile classes in competitive environments is NOT
//        worth the added dropped packs. It would be advised to simply stick with cl_interp 0.0304
//        regardless of ratio being 1 or 2.
//Note 3: Setting cl_interp to 0 defaults the value to 0.007, which is not stable - you will drop packets.

rate 160000 //Max bytes/sec the host can receive data (default is 80000). Keep at 100000 or higher (80000 * 2 = 160000).
//Note: Another common value FOR SOME REASON is 60000 however this is bad, do not use this... This will only limit connection speeds!

cl_pred_optimize 2

cl_smoothtime 0.01

tf_mm_custom_ping_enabled 1
tf_mm_custom_ping 51 //50 (always subtracts 1)
