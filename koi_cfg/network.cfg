//Server tickrates
//TF2 is designed to only use 66 tick servers unless you do some weird voodoo magic
//Because of this, it is advised to use the following 2 network settings:
cl_cmdrate 66
cl_updaterate 66
//As expected, if for whatever weird reason you play on 128 / 132 tick servers, use the following:
//cl_cmdrate 128 / 132
//cl_updaterate 128 / 132

//Interp settings
//ASSUMING YOU PLAY ON 66 TICK SERVERS (see above for details)
//Projectile classes: use cl_interp 0.0152 and cl_interp_ratio 1
// (cl_interp_ratio 1 / cl_updaterate 66 = 0.01515151515 - round this value up to 0.0152 for interp)
//Hitscan classes: use cl_interp 0.0304 and cl_interp_ratio 2
// (cl_interp_ratio 2 / cl_updaterate 66 = 0.0303030303 - round this value up to 0.0304 for interp)
cl_interp 0.0304 //Note: setting this to 0 defaults to 0.007, which is not stable - you will drop packets
cl_interp_ratio 2
//Note 1: Many servers restrict cl_interp_ratio to be 1. This will not impact the above settings since
//        cl_interp 0.0304 will override ratio 1's 0.01515151515 value anyway.
//Note 2: Yes you can still use cl_interp 0.0152 and cl_interp_ratio 1 for hitscan classes but be cautious
//        of your network connection strength and connection to the server, since this is risky and may
//        result in hits not connecting.
//        You can also use cl_interp 0.0304 and cl_interp_ratio 2 for projectile classes but typically
//        this puts you at an incredibly tiny disadvantage compared to cl_interp 0.0152 and cl_interp_ratio 1.

rate 100000 //Max bytes/sec the host can receive data (default is 80000)
//            Another common value is 60000 however this is bad, do not use this... Do not limit connection
cl_lagcompensation 1
cl_pred_optimize 2
cl_smooth 0
cl_smoothtime 0.01

tf_mm_custom_ping_enabled 1
tf_mm_custom_ping 51 //50 (always subtracts 1)

cl_timeout 150 //default is 30 seconds before disconnect, this boosts to 2 min 30 seconds
