mat_monitorgamma 1.7 //controls FULLSCREEN brightness (not windowed borderless). Note 1: values range from 1.6 brightest to 2.6 darkest - default appears to be 2.2 although 2.1 is the true middle value. Note 2: Valve seems to indicate "typically 2.2 for CRT and 1.7 for LCD" and so this is set to 1.7 to match Valve's note
