//A few notes about this script and why is works
//problem 1: "voice_enable 0" does not work in this script because "voice_enable 1" DOES NOT instantly bring back voice capabilities UNLESS you rejoin the server. This is not acceptable. 
//solution 1: use "voice_modenable 0" instead. This command also disables voicechat but "voice_modenable 1" DOES instantly bring back voice capabilities.
//problem 2: "voice_modenable 0" will automatically re-enable back to "voice_modenable 1" if you press your voicechat key at any time. This obviously defeats the purpose of the script.
//solution 2: unbind the voicechat key when disabling voice, re-bind the voicechat key when re-enabling. This prevents "voice_modenable 1" from accidentally being triggered.
